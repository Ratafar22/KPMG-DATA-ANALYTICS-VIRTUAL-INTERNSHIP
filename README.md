# KPMG-DATA-ANALYTICS-VIRTUAL-INTERNSHIP
Sprocket Central Ltd. Is a company that deals in the sales of bikes.
They had a list of new customers who do not have prior transactions with them and they wanted to know which customers they should target using the existing customers’ data.
I analyzed the old customer’s data to check for trends and patterns and was able to advise on the new customers based on the existing data.
